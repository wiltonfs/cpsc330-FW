    "In lecture 17, we talked about natural language processing (NLP). Using pre-trained word embeddings is very common in NLP. It has been shown that pre-trained word embeddings [work well on a variety of text classification tasks](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/721.pdf). These embeddings are created by training a model like Word2Vec on a huge corpus of text such as a dump of Wikipedia or a dump of the web crawl. \n",

In general, without being very selective with my words, the model performed very well in avoiding bias and stereotypes.
